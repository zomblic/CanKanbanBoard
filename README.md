-----> Clicked Link
Work smartered, not harder option!
Where the empty text with the faint 'San Deigo', type in your city and have your five day forecast appear! Easy. Simple as that!



-----> Had to do it the hard way? Really?
In your terminal, the farthest out folder, meaning the folder that contains all the code, open your terminal and type 'npm i'. Wait a few mintues as all the dependencies install, including vite. Still in the terminal, type 'npm run start:dev' it will kickstart and automatically load. Type in the city name and you're done!

    To the bootcamp for providing the readme for the assignment,

    Classmates for forming study groups to problem solve and figure it out -- thanks to Zach M and Nick D for helping with debugging!
    Tutors (Ainsley) and TAs for being patient and helping us out,

    Google (and the many, many, many websites that offered advice, tibits and a variety of coding exmaples-- StackOverflow and GeekdforGeeks mainly),

    Co-Pilot, ChatGPT and Xpert for identifying debugging and slightly tweaking (not sure how to succesfully cite debugged code tho) as well as breaking down code, explaining it and over several examples.

    And Vs Code!
    
      ... we don't talk about gitbash.
